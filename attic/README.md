## Deprecated Drivers

GraphsDFG is dependent on the archived Graphs.jl and no longer maintained from DFG v0.8.
See https://github.com/JuliaRobotics/DistributedFactorGraphs.jl/issues/398 for more detail.

MetaGraphsDFG and SymbolDFG are unlikely to be revived again.

The old Graphs (git tags v0.2.5 through v0.10.3) is now replaced by LightGraphs v1.3.5 and is functionally equivalent.
The new GraphsDFG is therefore an exact replacement of LightDFG to follow the transition of LightGraphs to Graphs
