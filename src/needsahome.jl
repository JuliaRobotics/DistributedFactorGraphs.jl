#                  Into, Labels, Subgraph are all implied from the parameters.

    $SIGNATURES
Construct a new factor graph object as a subgraph of `dfg <: AbstractDFG` based on the
variable labels `syms::Vector{Symbols}`.

SamC: Can we not just use _copyIntoGraph! for this? Looks like a small refactor to make it work.
Will paste in as-is for now and we can figure it out as we go.

Notes
- Slighly messy internals, but gets the job done -- some room for performance improvement.
- Defaults to GraphDFG, but likely to change to LightDFG in future.

DevNotes
- TODO: still needs to be consolidated with `DFG._copyIntoGraph`

# IIF clique specific version of building subgraphs.  This is was an unfortunate rewrite of the existing `buildSubgraphFromLabels!` function above.  Currently halfway consolidated.  Tests required to ensure these two functions can be reduced to and will perform the same in both.
