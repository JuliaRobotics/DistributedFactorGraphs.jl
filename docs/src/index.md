# Introduction

DistributedFactorGraphs.jl provides a flexible factor graph API for use in the [Caesar.jl](https://github.com/JuliaRobotics/Caesar.jl) ecosystem. The package supplies:
* A standardized API for interacting with factor graphs
* Implementations of the API for in-memory and database-driven operation
* Visualization extensions to validate the underlying graph

**Note** this package is still under initial development, and will adopt parts of the functionality currently contained in [IncrementalInference.jl](http://www.github.com/JuliaRobotics/IncrementalInference.jl).

## Installation

DistributedFactorGraphs can be installed from Julia packages using:
```julia
julia> ]add DistributedFactorGraphs
```
